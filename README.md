# VR Space Shooter

## Project Description
VR Space Shooter is a VR game where you maneuver a spaceship around a space environment, dodging asteroids and shooting enemy ships with laser beams. It is controlled by a Google Cardboard headset and a VR remote controller; you move your ship with the joystick and shoot with the trigger. The space environment will move asteroids towards you and spawn enemies randomly for you to shoot.
